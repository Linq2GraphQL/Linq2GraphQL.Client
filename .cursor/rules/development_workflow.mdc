# DEPRECATED: Development Workflow Guidelines

**⚠️ This rule has been consolidated into [consolidated_workflow.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/consolidated_workflow.mdc)**

This file is kept for reference but should not be used. All workflow guidelines have been moved to the consolidated workflow rule for better organization and reduced duplication.
