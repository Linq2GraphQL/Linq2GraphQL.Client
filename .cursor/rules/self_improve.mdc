# Rule Self-Improvement Guidelines

## Pattern Recognition Triggers
- New code patterns not covered by existing rules (3+ occurrences)
- Repeated similar implementations across files
- Common error patterns that could be prevented
- New libraries or tools being used consistently
- Emerging best practices in the codebase

## Analysis Process
- Compare new code with existing rules
- Identify patterns that should be standardized
- Look for references to external documentation
- Check for consistent error handling patterns
- Monitor test patterns and coverage

## Rule Creation Criteria
**Add New Rules When:**
- A new technology/pattern is used in 3+ files
- Common bugs could be prevented by a rule
- Code reviews repeatedly mention the same feedback
- New security or performance patterns emerge

**Modify Existing Rules When:**
- Better examples exist in the codebase
- Additional edge cases are discovered
- Related rules have been updated
- Implementation details have changed

## Quality Assurance
- Rules must be actionable and specific
- Examples should come from actual code
- References must be up to date
- Patterns should be consistently enforced

## Rule Maintenance
- Monitor code review comments
- Track common development questions
- Update rules after major refactors
- Add links to relevant documentation
- Cross-reference related rules
- Mark outdated patterns as deprecated
- Document migration paths for old patterns
